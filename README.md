### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name's Anthony (I go as Magic online). I specialise as a Web Developer and I prefer using React. Take a look below to find out about a few of my projects:
- Plugin Developer (personal project) - creating plugins for friends using C# and the EXILED API for the game SCP: Secret Laboratory.
- Developer (DiscoveryMC) - developed and maintained some back-end plugins in Java for the Minecraft Server.
- Noxcrew (present) - Web Developer for the MC Championship event.

Feel free to say hi!
