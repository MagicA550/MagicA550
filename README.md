### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name's Anthony (I go as Magic online). I specialise in web development, predominantly in the React ecosystem. The vast majority of my work on GitHub is in private repositories, usually for schoolwork and side-projects.

At the moment, I am working for [Noxcrew](https://noxcrew.com/) as a web developer. My projects include [MCC Live](https://mcc.live), a live statistics tracker for the MC Championship event, and the [MCC Island Beta Signup](https://mccisland.net), an email selection system for the MCC Island closed beta. Within Minecraft I have also helped to create a [concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv-0KMXKFp4) in collaboration with YouTube, BTS and MÃ¥neskin.

I've also done voluntary development work in the Minecraft space in both Java and show development. On a similar note, I have a working experience in Python from data manipulation  and TensorFlow-related projects and have created plugins for Unity games in C#.

Feel free to say hi!
